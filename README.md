CryptoHub is a cryptocurrency news platform integrated with Telegram and OpenAI.  
AI extracts which cryptocurrencies are mentioned in each post, allowing users to filter content by **token** or **author**.

Users can comment on posts and leave reactions, which are later saved in their profile.

Authentication is available via **email (OTP)** or **Google Auth**, with optional **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** for additional account security.

Clone the repository to explore the CryptoHub project.
